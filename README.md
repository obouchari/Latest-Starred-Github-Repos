# Latest Starred Github Repos

Web app that lists the most starred Github repos that were created in the last 30 days.

### Technology Used in this project:
- Javascript (React)
- HTML/CSS

## Why React?
I used React in this project for the following reasons:
- I'm already familiar with the library.
- React is considered one of the most used libraries in today's web apps.
- I would have used Angular, But in this case it was going to be an overkill since Angular comes with a full package of features that are not required for this project.
